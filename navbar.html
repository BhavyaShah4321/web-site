                take a detailed look at what happens when you create a grid container and the various properties that can be 
                applied to the container to shape your grid.This is the start of a new series here at Smashing Magazine 
                concentrating on CSS Grid Layout. While Grid has been available in browsers since 2017, many developers won’t 
                have had a chance to use it on a project yet. There seem to be a lot of new properties and values associated 
                with CSS Grid Layout. This can make it seem overwhelming. However, quite a lot of the specification details 
                alternate ways to do things, meaning that you don’t have to learn the entire spec to get started. This series 
                aims to take you from grid novice to expert — with lots of practical usage tips along the way.</div>

                various properties that you can use on the parent element to control that grid. You will discover that there
